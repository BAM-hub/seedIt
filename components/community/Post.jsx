        Black spot is a fungal disease commonly found on roses, but also on
        other flowers and fruits. While it doesnâ€™t kill plants outright, it
        weakens them and makes them susceptible to other problems. In cool,
        moist weather, small black spots appear on foliage, which starts to turn
        yellow and eventually drops off.
